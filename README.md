# massDeleteDiscordDM

Script not created by me, but it lacks any real documentation.
Also this makes it easier for me to find it again.

This is a script to mass-delete direct messages(DMs) on Discord.

Replace LAST_MESSAGE_ID with the ID of the most recent message. KEEP '' AROUND ID.
Copy ID of message by clicking the 3 dots on message.

Replace AUTH_TOKEN with TOKEN under Application>Local Storage>https://discordapp.com. KEEP "" AROUND TOKEN.
Token may only be visible during refreshing, so inspect element, go to above directory, press F5 and quickly copy the token by double clicking and CTRL+C/CMD+C.

Script is to be run by opening Discord via the website. (https://discordapp.com/app)
Inspect element>Console

Paste content of script and run.
It will throw an error when trying to delete other members messages, this is expected.
